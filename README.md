# Website Performance Analysis

# Objective: 

        The project focuses on analyzing website traffic and engagement data to uncover insights about user behavior, 
        marketing channel effectiveness, and engagement patterns.
# Data :

      The dataset was imported from a CSV file (data-export (1).csv).
Columns were cleaned and renamed for clarity, including:
        Channel Group, DateHours, Users, Sessions, Engaged Sessions,
        Average Engagement Time per Session, Engaged Sessions per User,
        Events per Session, Engagement Rate, Event Count.
# Business Questions Solved:

# Engagement Rate Across Channels:
     Distribution of engagement rate by traffic source.
# Engaged vs. Non-Engaged Sessions
     Comparison of session quality across channels.
     Suggests strategies for improving underperforming sources
# Traffic by Hours of the Day:
     Identifies peak traffic hours for different channels.
# Correlation Between Traffic & Engagement Rate
     Explores whether more sessions correlate with higher engagement.
# Techniques Used:
   Pandas & NumPy → Data cleaning & preprocessing.
   Matplotlib & Seaborn → Visualization of trends, comparisons, and distributions.
   
# Insights (based on project structure)
    Certain marketing channels are significantly better at driving traffic.
    Engagement metrics (like time and rate) vary widely by channel.
    Time-based analysis highlights daily/weekly traffic patterns.
    Understanding correlation between traffic and engagement helps refine digital strategies.
